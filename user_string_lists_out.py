String Lists 1. Using Python Built-in functions

Here are the number of artists we have to choose from: 6

Here are the verbs we can choose from: {'painted', 'drew', 'carved', 'sculpted'}

Here is the tuple of colors and nouns: (('red', 'paintings'), ('green', 'sculptures'), ('blue', 'carvings'), ('yellow', 'drawings'))



String Lists 2. Random Choice

Here is a random artists from the list: Salvidor

Here is a random, and probably factually incorrect, art sentence: Pablo drew tiny red paintings.



String Lists 3. Get Unique Words

The number of words in Shakespear's play Hamlet is: 31999.

The number of unique words in Shakespear's play Hamlet is: 7714. I would say that is an impressive list of words!
